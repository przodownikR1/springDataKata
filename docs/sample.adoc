  represents a unit of work and is bound to the current thread
  It also represents a
 transaction in a database. A session begins when getCurrentSession() is first called on the current thread.
 The Session object is then bound to the current thread. When the transaction ends with a commit or
 rollback, Hibernate unbinds the session from the thread and closes it.

Retrieving and Persisting Objects
Book book = (Book) session.load(Book.class, isbn);    
  when the given ID can’t be found, the load() method throws an org.hibernate.ObjectNotFoundException exception
  he load() method just returns a proxy by default; the database  isn’t hit until the proxy is first invoked
  
Book book = (Book) session.get(Book.class, isbn);
   get() method returns a null object
   get() method hits the database immediately
   
The load() method is useful when you need only a proxy, not’ a database call. You need only a proxy in a given session  when you have to associate an entity before persisting.

EntityManagerFactory has the same role as SessionFactory in Hibernate. It acts a factory class that
provides the EntityManager class to the application.


JTA is used in J2EE-managed applications in which the container is responsible for  transaction propagation.
For application-managed transactions, you can use RESOURCE_LOCAL.

Providing an ID for Persistence

 ID element has attributes such as column, type, and generator that you use to generate the identifier.
 
•	 Database sequence
•	 Native generator
•	 Increment generator
•	 Hilo generator

Some of these strategies are available only for specified databases; for instance, the sequence strategy is
not supported in MYSQL, but it is provided by Oracle.

Sequence:
[source,java]
----
@Id  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
public Long id;
----

Enhanced Sequence Style Generator

Optimization allows you to query a bunch of identifiers at a time and store them in local memory.
Once they have been exhausted, the database can be queried for the next group of identifiers, which avoids
making a call to the database for every new identifier.
Use the GenericGenerator tag for these enhanced generators:
 
[source,java]
----
@GeneratedValue( generator="IdGen")
@GenericGenerator(strategy="org.hibernate.id.enhanced.SequenceStyleGenerator",name="IdGen",
parameters = {
@Parameter(name = "sequence_name", value = "seq_id_gen"),
@Parameter(name = "optimizer", value = "pooled"),
@Parameter(name = "initial_value", value = "1000"),
@Parameter(name = "increment_size", value = "10")
})
----

The initial value is set to 1000 and the increment size is 10. The optimizer
values can be one of the following:
•	 none does not perform any optimizations and hits the database for every new
identifier
•	 hilo generates the identifiers according to the hi/lo algorithm
•	 pooled stores the high value in the series as the nextval
•	 pooled-lo stores the low value in the series as the nextval


[source,java]
---- 
@Id
@GeneratedValue( generator="IdGen")
@GenericGenerator(strategy="org.hibernate.id.enhanced.SequenceStyleGenerator",name="IdGen",
parameters = {
@Parameter(name = "sequence_name", value = "seq_id_gen"),
@Parameter(name = "optimizer", value = "pooled"),
@Parameter(name = "initial_value", value = "1000"),
@Parameter(name = "increment_size", value = "10")
})
----



Increment reads the maximum primary key column value from the table and increments the value by one.
[source,java]
----
@Id  @GeneratedValue(generator = "increment")
public Long id;
----   
   
Hilo Generator uses the hi/lo algorithm to generate the identifiers that are unique to a particular database.
It retrieves the high value from a global source (by default, the hibernate_unique_key table and next_hi
column), and the low value from a local source. The max_lo value option is provided to define how many low
values are added before a high value is fetched
[source,java]
----
@Id
@GeneratedValue(generator = "hilo")
public Long id;
----

The hilo generator is of type long. This generator should not be used with a user-supplied connection.
The high value must be fetched in a separate transaction from the Session transaction, so the generator must
be able to obtain a new connection and commit it. Hence, this implementation cannot be used when the user
is supplying connections. In that case, a SequenceHiLoGenerator is a better choice (where supported).
The hilo generator is used for batch operations


Enhanced Table Generator
This generator defines a table that holds the increment values, and the same table can be used by multiple
applications for the increment values. Each application is distinguished by the key value.
[source,java]
----
@GeneratedValue( generator="TableIdGen")
@GenericGenerator(strategy="org.hibernate.id.enhanced.TableGenerator",name="TableIdGen",
parameters = {
@Parameter(name = "table_name", value = "enhanced_hibernate_sequences"),
@Parameter(name = "segment_value", value = "id"),
@Parameter(name = "optimizer", value = "pooled"),
@Parameter(name = "initial_value", value = "1000"),
@Parameter(name = "increment_size", value = "10")
})
----

Creating a Composite Key
 
[source,java]
----
public class EmployeeId implements Serializable {
Long department;
Long idCard;

 
@Entity
@IdClass(EmployeeId.class)
public class Employee {
@Id
Long department;
@Id
Long idCard;
----


Composite ID as a Property Using a Component Type
[source,java]
----
@Embeddable
public class ISBN implements Serializable {
@Column(name = "group_number")
int group;
int publisher;
int titleRef;
int checkDigit;
}


@Entity
public class Book {
@Id
ISBN id;
@Column
String title;
----



==klucz naturalny

There are two options to get around this problem:
• Don’t use a generated identifier strategy (and instead assign an entity identifier
when the domain object is first instantiated)
• Base equals() and hashCode() on business equality, rather than row equality
Using an assigned identifier strategy isn’t too difficult, but can impose some limitations on your application.
Generally, the recommended approach is to generate equals() and hashCode() using the values of key
properties of a domain object—specifically, properties that define an object’s uniqueness from a business
logic perspective.
Here is an example of a customized equals and hashCode for the Category domain object:
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
if (this == o) return true;
if (!(o instanceof Category)) return false;
Category category = (Category) o;
if (categoryName != null ?
!categoryName.equals(category.categoryName) : category.categoryName != null) {
return false;
} else {
return true;
}
}
@Override
public int hashCode() {

Hibernate is able to maintain entity equivalence only within a single EntityManager scope. If you attempt to
reattach a detached entity, Hibernate is no longer able to make the same guarantees. The way to resolve
this problem is to override equals() and hashCode() for each of your domain objects, providing equality
rules that are reflective of its identity within the database.
The simplest approach is to use an entity’s identifier to determine equality and generate its hash code.
However, if you are planning to use a generated identifier strategy, this can have negative implications.
When an object is first created, it will have a default null identifier. If you attempt to add this newly created
entity to a java.util.Set and then later save this instance, the invocation of EntityManager.save() will
trigger an identifier to be generated for the entity in question. However, because you have based equals
and hashCode on the object’s identifier, you will run into a situation where the hashCode for the object
suddenly changes. This change breaks the contract for many of the Java collection types, such as Set , and
could lead to unexpected behavior in your application.


== Usuwanie

If the record does not exist in the database, you will face the Exception in thread
"main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: attempt to create delete
event with null entity exception because get() returns the null object while you try
to delete that object.

However, if you use the following code to delete the record, you will face another type of error:
Employee employee = new Employee();
employee.setId(1);
session.delete(employee);
When the preceding code is executed, you will face the Exception in thread "main"
org.hibernate.StaleStateException: Batch update returned unexpected
row count from update [0]; actual row count: 0; expected: 1 " exception.
This is because we are trying to delete Employee#1 from the database (which does not
exist), and the employee object is also not null; so, it throws an error.

There are many cases where you may face an exception; for example, when you try to remove
a parent object that is referred to by the child object. In such cases, you will get a foreign
key constraint violated exception.

If the record does not exist in the database, you will face the Exception in thread
"main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: attempt to create delete
event with null entity exception because get() returns the null object while you try
to delete that object.
However, if you use the following code to delete the record, you will face another type of error:
Employee employee = new Employee();
employee.setId(1);
session.delete(employee);
When the preceding code is executed, you will face the Exception in thread "main"
org.hibernate.StaleStateException: Batch update returned unexpected
row count from update [0]; actual row count: 0; expected: 1 " exception.
This is because we are trying to delete Employee#1 from the database (which does not
exist), and the employee object is also not null; so, it throws an error.


== aktualizacja


In the preceding section, we used the update() method for updating a particular
record. Apart from this method, hibernate will provide one more useful method called
saveOrUpdate() .
This particular method is used to save or update records. Hibernate updates the records for a
given object if the identifier field is given. If an identifier is not given, then hibernate will insert
a new record.


== merge

Merging is performed when you desire to have a detached entity changed to persistent state again, with the detached
entity’s changes migrated to (or overriding) the database. The method signatures for the merge operations are:

 
Merging is the inverse of refresh(), which overrides the detached entity’s values with the values from the
database

== reload


These methods will reload the properties of the object from the database, overwriting them; thus, as stated,
refresh() is the inverse of merge(). Merging overrides the database with the values held by the previously transient
object, and refresh() overrides the values in the transient object with the values in the database.
